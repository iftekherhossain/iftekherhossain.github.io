## üíª Projects
- [FastAPI CRUD with Basic Authentication](https://github.com/iftekherhossain/fastapi-crud-authentication)
Developed a FastAPI application that supports CRUD operations with integrated Basic Authentication. The system prioritizes secure data access through protected endpoints.

- [A Home Security System with Social Interaction.](https://github.com/iftekherhossain/Final-Year-Project)
 A complete home security system is designed to act as a digital security guard. Face recognition, Voice recognition, Voice synthesis, and IoT technologies are used to make the system robust and user‚Äëfriendly. Faces are recognized using the Facenet model and a technique applied here to make the system faster and more accurate, called ‚ÄúMean Embeddings‚Äù. The webserver was designedusing the Django framework.
[Smart Eye Controlled Wheelchair for Disabled Person.](https://github.com/iftekherhossain/eye_tracking)
Designed a wheelchair controlled by eye movements, enabling disabled individuals to move around easily and independently usingsimply by their eye movements. Color Sorting with Computer Vision. Developed an advanced computer vision system capable of accurately identifying and sorting objects based on their color variations.
[Face Recognition using Mean Embeddings.](https://github.com/iftekherhossain/Facenet-Face-Recognition)
Developed a cutting‚Äëedge facial recognition system leveraging Facenet. A novel method, ‚ÄùMean Embeddings,‚Äù was introduced, resulting in a significant performance boost‚Äîachieving a 6.5 times speed increase and enhancing accuracy by 1.6 Face Recognition‚Äëbased People Counter on Raspberry Pi 4 Developed a system that accurately counts individuals using the Facenet architecture for face recognition. This innovative people counter has been efficiently implemented on a Raspberry Pi 4.
[Conveyor Object Detection using OpenCV]()
Implemented a real‚Äëtime detection system that identifies objects on a moving conveyor based on their shape, size, and color. Leveraging the capabilities of OpenCV, the project efficiently classifies and analyzes objects, optimizing conveyor operations.
[Intelligent Voice Assistant using Rasa Framework.](https://github.com/iftekherhossain/Voice-Assistant-Rasa)
Engineered a real‚Äëtime voice assistant that provides intelligent responses. Utilized the advanced capabilities of the Rasa framework
to ensure dynamic and interactive user experiences.
